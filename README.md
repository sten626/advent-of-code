# advent-of-code

My eternal repo for all future Advent of Code problems. I'm using Typescript because I like using it and like having more reasons to use it.

## Setup

Having checked out this repository, run the following command to install dependencies.

```shell
npm install
```

## Running Solutions

I've created a helper script to help with executing my solutions. It can be ran via npm with the command:

```shell
npm run solve <year> <day>
```

This will execute the given solution file using `ts-node`.

You can also run solutions in VS Code using the included run configuration and the recommended extension [TypeScript Debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kakumei.ts-debug).
